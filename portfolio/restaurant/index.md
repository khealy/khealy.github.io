## Executive Summary


## Assignment
The fictional Taste of the World Caf√©, a restaurant serving international cuisine, debuted a new menu at the beginning of the year. The business owner wants to get an understanding of how the new menu items are doing with customers: what's doing well and what's not, and what the top customers like best.

## Data Analysis
The data I've received is in a MySQL database, and consists of 2 tables:
- menu_items
- order_detail

The are 3 months of orders to analyze, covering January-March.

### Menu Items Table
```
/* set restaurant_db as the my default db */
