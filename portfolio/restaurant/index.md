## Assignment
The fictional Taste of the World Caf√©, a restaurant serving international cuisine, debuted a new menu at the beginning of the year. The business owner wants to get an understanding of how the new menu items are doing with customers: what's doing well and what's not, and what the top customers like best.

Because the owner wants the information quickly and the data is in a MySQL database, all of the analysis will be done in SQL.

## Executive Summary
The menu has 32 items across 4 different international cuisines:
- Italian (9)
- Asian (8)
- Mexican (9)
- American (6)

Prices range from $5 (Edamame) to $19.95 (Shrimp Scampi), with an average menu item price of $13.29. Italian is the highest-priced category on average ($16.75), followed by Asian ($13.48). 

## Detailed Analysis
The restaurant consists of 2 tables:
- menu_items
- order_detail

The are 3 months of orders to analyze, covering January-March.
